# YOGA WEBSITE

The idea of this website is to introduce the meaning and more details of the YOGA exercise. In future work, we will add more features as showing some real and live videos to enhance the purpose of yoga and encourage clients to follow and start to do some of these exercises. Contact with Instructors and see the nearest place that offers yoga sessions for our clients.

# Technologies and languages:
 
 HTML, CSS


# Note:

Currently, this website is simple for a demo(not found at any search engine) and practical usage of the html5 and css3 technologies. The developer seeks a more advanced and professional level. More technologies are going to be used to improve the website, such as BootStrap, JavaScript, JavaScript Framework, and some backend languages and tools to make it alive and available. That's why you will find the project inside the version one folder.  The website works only on desktop browsers.
